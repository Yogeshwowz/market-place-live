                                                      As a business owner considers placing his or her company on the market, ascertaining
                                                      the proper value for the company is critical. Too often the owner assigns an unrealistic
                                                      and unachievable arbitrary value then proceeds to the sale process only to be
                                                      disappointed with the market’s response. As a result, the asking price is
                                                      reduced several times. During this unfortunate period buyer prospects and valuable
                                                      time is lost.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                      In truth, a company’s value is determined by a compilation of factors such
                                                      as the company’s sales, earnings, performance, market outlook, personnel,
                                                      net book value and fair market replacement value of equivalent operating assets.
                                                      But it can also be influenced by intangible assets like the company’s image,
                                                      reputation and goodwill.

                                                  <p>
                                                      There are several approaches to valuing your business.

                                                      <b>Balance Sheet Value </b>
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                      There are several balance sheet valuation methods, including adjusted book value,
                                                      book value and liquidation value. The adjusted book value is determined by revising
                                                      the asset’s book value to reflect the cost it would take to replace the assets
                                                      in their current condition. This method requires the total values to be offset against
                                                      the sum of the liabilities.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                      The book value considers the figures from the company’s financial records,
                                                      as depreciated at the time of the sale. The book value can pose some difficulties
                                                      for sellers, particularly if the seller has depreciated the assets too much to gain
                                                      prior tax advantages.
                                                  </p>
                                                  <p>
                                                      The liquidation value is the amount that could be realized if all assets –
                                                      equipment, furnishings and inventory – were sold separately. This value is
                                                      typically much lower since it doesn’t consider a company’s intrinsic
                                                      value.

                                                      The income approach takes into consideration the company’s level of earnings
                                                      using a capitalization rate, discount rate or multiplier. Several income approach
                                                      methods are frequently used. Each method requires a level of earnings and a conversion
                                                      factor to translate the earnings into a company value. Selecting the proper level
                                                      of earnings – after-tax, pretax, discretionary or cash flow – and matching
                                                      it with the proper conversion factor – discount rate, cap rate or a multiplier
                                                      – is critical to calculating a reasonable value.

                                                      The market approach sets a value based on the values of other businesses that have
                                                      been sold. Setting the market value involves researching the sale prices for similar
                                                      businesses in a geographic area. In some cases, however, finding a company that
                                                      is similar in many ways to your company may be difficult.

                                                      Whatever your goal, you want a good advisor to help you assess the value of your
                                                      company. Question your advisor on the effects of deal structure and how multiples
                                                      are used. A business owner should never accept a computer-generated valuation or
                                                      a one-size-fits-all approach when selling the business. And don't be impressed
                                                      by the person who presents the highest value – you may only be setting yourself
                                                      up for failure during the sale process.

                                                      not be the only consideration. You don’t want just any buyer, you want the
                                                      best buyer. With the market we’re now experiencing, many sellers are getting

                                                      the most money. Would you consider a lower price for a buyer that fits the company’s
                                                      culture? Would you consider an offer that’s a million dollars lower if it

                                                      the wrong impression which can have serious consequences. There aren’t any

                                                      A prospective buyer may ask how long you’ll stick around after the sale and you may casually respond that you’ll be around as long as needed. Then you find out that the buyer is thinking about a two year transition when you and your wife had been discussing a potential move to Florida.

Had your initial response been that you would be around three to six months and then could provide consulting services from Florida, the buyer would not be counting on long-term support. Remember, it’s always easier to give the buyer more than expected than take something away.

                                                      If you’re looking to sell a business, it’s critical to look at the value of the business. But a typical business really has two values. The “academic” value is the one determined by a professional business valuation. The other is the “true market” value. The academic value arrives at with a formula based on the firms’ hard assets, cash flow, industry averages and multiples. The fair market value also takes those items into consideration, but then considers what buyers are really willing to pay.

For some small businesses there may be no hard assets at all. Instead, their value is based on intangibles like employees, business processes, customer lists, location and business relationships.

They spruce things up and make sure everything is in its right place. Yet, in business, that’s rarely considered. A well-maintained facility will get the best price. Even businesses that lease space can benefit from a thorough cleaning and organization to convey a feeling of quality and efficiency.

                                                      Keep these important intangible assets in mind if you’re looking to sell your business. They convey a value that financial statements alone do not. If you are looking to sell, make a plan. Start working on the intangibles well in advance of putting your business on the market. For many business owners, they reach a point where they burn out and psychologically retire early, before a sale is made. It’s
                                                      important to work to keep your focus right until the sale is complete.

                                                      Finally, when the time to put your business on the market arrives, consider lining up key specialists who will help you make the most of the sale – an attorney, an accountant, and a business intermediary to name a few. Remember, you only have one chance to sell your business, so you want to do it right.
