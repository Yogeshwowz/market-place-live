        <p>
            <b>Analyse your business idea</b>
       
            Is your idea feasible? Before you get started, find out if there is a demand for
            your products or services. It's also useful to find out who your competitors
            are and whether the market can sustain your business.
        </p>
        <p>
            Researching all aspects of your business idea will involve gathering, analysing
            and evaluating information to help you write your business goals. Some questions
            to consider are:
        </p>
        <p>
            •&nbsp; What product/service will you provide?<br>
            •&nbsp; Is your idea viable?<br>
            •&nbsp; How will you protect your ideas?<br>
            •&nbsp; Is there a market for your product/service?<br>
            •&nbsp; What skills do you need?
            <br>
            •&nbsp; Who are your competitors?
            <br>
            •&nbsp; What difference will you bring to the market?
            <br>
            •&nbsp; Do you have the financial capacity to start a business?
        </p>
        <p>
            <b> Analyse yourself</b>
        
            Are you ready to venture into business? Operating a small business is not just about
            working for yourself, it's also about having the necessary management skills,
            industry expertise, technical skills, finance and of course a long-term vision to
            grow and succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
            At the outset it’s important to consider whether you really understand what's
            involved and whether you're suited to business and self employment. Examine
            these questions:
        </p>
        <p>
            •&nbsp; Why are you starting a business?
            <br>
            •&nbsp; What are your business and personal goals?<br>
            •&nbsp; What are your skills?
            <br>
            •&nbsp; What income do you need to generate?
            <br>
            •&nbsp; What are the advantages and disadvantages of starting your own business?
        </p>

        <h2 class="bg-gray" id="para2">Business planning </h2>
        <p>
            Once you've conducted research into the feasibility of your new business you're
            ready to write your business plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            A business plan provides direction, keeps you on track and is usually a requirement
            when you seek finance. Depending on your business type, your plan could include
            the following sections:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>Business Summary:</b> A one-page overview written
            after your business plan is finalised.
            <br>
            <b>About your business:</b> This is typically called
            the management plan or operations plan. It covers details about your business including
            structure, registrations, location and premises, staff, and products/services.
            <br>
            <b>About your market: </b>This is the marketing
            plan. It should outline your marketing analysis of the industry you are entering,
            your customers and your competitors. This section should also cover your key marketing
            targets and your strategies for delivering on these targets.
            <br>
            <b>About your future:</b> This section covers your
            plans for the future and can include a vision statement, business goals and key
            business milestones.
            <br>
            <b>About your finances:</b> The financial plan includes
            how you'll finance your business, costing and financial projections.
        </p>

        <p>
            <b>Regular review:</b>
            business planning is an ongoing business activity. As your business changes many
            of the strategies in your plan will need to evolve to ensure you business is still
            heading in the right direction. Having your plan up to date can keep you focused
            on where you are heading and ensure you are ready when you need it again.
        </p>


        <h2 class="bg-gray" id="para3">Distributing &amp; protecting your plan</h2>
        <p>
            A business plan is a blueprint for how your business will run and reveals what future
            direction your business will take. Understandably you will want to be careful who
            you show your plan to and avoid your competition seeing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Having an understanding with third parties when distributing a plan could be enough
            protection for some businesses, however others who have innovative business practices
            or products or services may wish to go further and sign a confidentiality agreement
            with each person to protect their innovations.
        </p>
        <p>
            It may also be a good idea to include some words in your plan asking the reader
            not to disclose the details of your plan.
        </p>
        <a name="Advice"></a>
        <h2 class="bg-gray" id="para4">Advice and support  </h2>

        <a name="Template"></a>
        <h2 class="bg-gray" id="para5">Using the template</h2>
        <p>
            Before you complete the business plan template and start using it, consider the
            following:
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>1. Do your research.</b> You will need to make
            quite a few decisions about your business including structure, marketing strategies
            and finances before you can complete the template. By having the right information
            to hand you also can be more accurate in your forecasts and analysis.
            <br>
            <b>2. Determine who the plan is for.</b> Does it
            have more than one purpose? Will it be used internally or will third parties be
            involved? Deciding the purpose of the plan can help you target your answers. If
            third parties are involved, what are they interested in? Although don’t assume
            they are just interested in the finance part of your business. They will be looking
            for the whole package.<br>
            <b>
                3. Do not attempt to fill in the template from start
                to finish.
            </b> First decide which sections are relevant for your business
            and set aside the sections that don’t apply. You can always go back to the
            other sections later.
            <br>

            4. <b>
                Use the [<span style="font-style: italic">
                    italicised
                    text
                </span>]
            </b>
            The italicised text is there to help guide you by providing
            some more detailed questions you may like to answer when preparing your response.
            Please note: If a question does not apply
            to your circumstances it can be ignored.<br>
            <b>5. Get some help.</b> If you aren’t confident
            in completing the plan yourself, you can enlist the help of a professional (i.e.
            business adviser, or accountant) to look through your plan and provide you with
            advice.<br>
            <b>6. Actual vs. expected figures.</b> Existing businesses
            can include actual figures in the plan, but if your business is just starting out
            and you are using expected figures for turnover and finances you will need to clearly
            show that these are expected figures or estimates.<br>
            <b>7. Write your summary last.</b> Use as few words
            as possible. You want to get to the point but not overlook important facts. This
            is also your opportunity to sell yourself. But don’t overdo it. You want prospective
            banks, investors, partners or wholesalers to be able to quickly read your plan,
            find it realistic and be motivated by what they read.<br>
            <b>8. Review. Review. Review.</b> Your business plan
            is there to make a good impression. Errors will only detract from your professional
            image. So ask a number of impartial people to proofread your final plan.
